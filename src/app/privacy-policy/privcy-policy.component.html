                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Information on Pristine Solutions.com and other Pristine Solutions websites is accrued in two ways: directly and indirectly. Pristine Solutions will at times ask you to provide information that individually identifies you (registering for an event, downloading a report, signing up for an email list, etc.). It is our policy to hold personal data only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected.
                            <br><br>
                            We do not usually seek to acquire sensitive or personal records via this website or in general. In cases wherein such information is collected, we do so according to privacy laws and requirements, and/or ask in your consent.
                            <br><br>
                            We may also gather personal information of our employees, potential employees, customers, suppliers, enterprise contacts, shareholders and site users:
                            <br><br>
                            <b>1.1</b> Information collected from website visitors. Pristine Solutions may also collect personal information in ways: (a) directly  (ex: invites to  join events, webinars, newsletters, etc), or (b) indirectly (includes what is collected via our website’s technology). Pristine Solutions does not require that you provide your personal data in order to receive information about our Services and offerings, but to the extent you have provided such information we may keep a record of that information for continued marketing contact, or for survey or research purposes.  Our website may collect personal information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration, traffic filtering, statistical reporting or troubleshooting of errors within our systems.  Please see the Cookies section below for more information with regard to how we handle information indirectly collected.
                            <br><br>
                            Pristine Solutions might use your personal information to: (i) process online job applications, (ii) fulfill your requests for ongoing receipt of white papers, articles, newsletters or other content, (iii) for surveys or studies questionnaires you agreed to take part in, (iv) contact you for advertising purposes when you have agreed to this action, and (v) personalize or improve your experience at our website when feedback is provided by you.
                            <br><br>
                            Retention and use of your personal records for the functions noted above is solely based on your prior consent, to the extent such consent is mandatory under applicable laws.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>1.2</b> Information used for advertising functions: The bulk of personal records Pristine Solutions collects and makes use of for marketing functions relates to individual employees of our clients and other companies with which we have existing business relationships.  We may also collect and maintain contact information from other sources, including content made public at social media websites, to make an initial contact with a relevant individual at a potential client or other company.  We may also combine data from publicly-available sources, as well as from our email, website and personal interactions with you to better assess your experience with Pristine Solutions.
                            <br><br>
                            Pristine Solutions does use customer relationship management database (CRM) technology to manage and track these marketing efforts, which may include personal information belonging to the individuals mentioned above, which could include contact information, publicly available data, your responses to targeted email, website activity of registered users of our website and other business information included by Pristine Solutions employees regarding any contact they may have with you.
                            <br><br>
                            Please contact us at info@pristineworldwide.com if you wish to be excluded from our CRM database.
