                <p class="lead mb-5">At Pristine Solutions, we use industry standard project management methodology with best practice process and techniques; this has been the key criteria for success in our engagements. Our overall and comprehensive project management framework is used for business change and project management. It incorporates product/technology/tool specific implementation methodology with an implementation roadmap addressing business process scenarios, customization, integration, and deployment of the solution.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">We follow recommended SAP best-practice methodology for fast implementation – Accelerated Implementation Project (AIP). This methodology has been developed over years and by using the experiences gathered from hundreds of implementations. Our consultants fully understand their client’s business so that decisions can be made jointly at each stage of the implementation process.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">We train end users and system admins on specific uses of their software solutions. We do this by delivering training through multiple modes including classroom training, hands-on training, on-the-job training, recorded training video, and reading materials.</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Additionally, Pristine trains the client’s own implementation team and uses a “train the trainer” approach for successful implementations.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Pristine has dedicated implementation teams for each software solution we do. These implementation teams are guided through a project management team.</p>
