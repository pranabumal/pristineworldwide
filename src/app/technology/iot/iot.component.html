                <h3>What makes the IoT possible?</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p class="lead mb-5">The IoT depends on a whole host of technologies – such as application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect devices to the Internet. Other key IoT technologies are Big Data management tools, predictive analytics, AI and machine learning, the cloud, and radio-frequency identification (RFID).
